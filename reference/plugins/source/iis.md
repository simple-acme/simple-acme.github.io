# IIS
Create source based on bindings configured in IIS. 
- Automatically updates webroot path (useful for [FileSystem validation](/reference/plugins/validation/http/filesystem))

# Filtering bindings
While it's possible to create a certificate for all bindings in all sites, typically you will want to select some 
specific bindings to create a certificate for. There are several filters available, that in some cases can also be
combined with eachother.

## Site filters
You can choose to limit the certificate to specific websites by specifying a site identifier, or a comma separated list 
of them. The magic value `s` will dynamically include all current and future websites created on the server.

## Binding filters
You can filter bindings by host name by specifically typing them out. It's also be possible to filter hosts by a pattern
or by a regular expression.

### Pattern
You may use a `*` for a range of any characters and a `?` for any single character. For example: the pattern `example.*` 
will match `example.net` and `example.com` (but not `my.example.com`). The pattern `?.example.com` will match 
`a.example.com` and `b.example.com` (but not `www.example.com`). Note that multiple patterns can be combined by 
comma seperating them.

### Regex
If a pattern is not powerful enough for you, there is the ultimate solution of applying a regular expression to the 
problem. [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) is a nice tool to help test your regular expression.

## Unattended 
- ##### Single binding
`‑‑source iis --host example.com [--siteid 1]`
- ##### Multiple bindings
`‑‑source iis --host example.com,www.example.com [--siteid 1,2,3] [--commonname common.example.com]`
- ##### All bindings of a site
`‑‑source iis --siteid 1 [--commonname common.example.com] [--excludebindings exclude.example.com]`
- ##### All bindings of multiple sites
`‑‑source iis --siteid 1,2,3 [--commonname common.example.com] [--excludebindings exclude.example.com]`
- ##### All bindings of all sites
`‑‑source iis --siteid s [--commonname common.example.com] [--excludebindings exclude.example.com]`
- ##### Binding pattern
`‑‑source iis --host-pattern *.example.??? [--siteid 1,2,3] [--commonname common.example.com] [--excludebindings exclude.example.com]`
- ##### Binging regex
`‑‑source iis --host-regex [a-z]{3}\.example(\.com|\.net) [--siteid 1,2,3] [--commonname common.example.com] [--excludebindings exclude.example.com]`
