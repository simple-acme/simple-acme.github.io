Use a certificate signing request generated by third party software. 
When this source plugin is chosen, you will obviously not be able to select 
a [CSR plugin](/reference/plugins/csr/) as well, meaning that any
customization and key selection requirements should already be met.

You can provide the program with static file location that the CSR will 
be read from, or provide it with a script that will dynamically request
or generate the CSR on demand.

Note that it's possible - though not required - to provide the private key to 
the program as well. If you do not provide the private key, the certificate
as stored by the [store plugins](/reference/plugins/store/) won't be usable
for server authentication. In that case you need to use an 
[installation script](/reference/plugins/installation/script) or 
[manual steps](https://www.digicert.com/kb/csr-creation-ssl-installation-iis-10.htm)
to finish the creation of a fully usable certificate.
