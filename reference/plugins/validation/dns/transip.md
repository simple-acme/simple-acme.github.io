# TransIP 
Create the record at [TransIP](https://www.transip.nl/). Note that this provider is not very 
fast updating its records after their API has accepted the changes, so it's highly recommended 
to roughly double either `PreValidateDnsRetryCount` and/or `PreValidateDnsRetryInterval` in 
`settings.json` when using DNS validation through them.

{% include plugin-seperate.md %}

## Setup
This requires you to activate the API in the "my account" section of the control panel and to create a key pair for simple-acme.

## Unattended 
- Key inline
`‑‑validation transip --transip-login xx --transip-privatekey `"---- PRIVATE KEY --- ...`"`
- Key in file:
`‑‑validation transip --transip-login xx --transip-privatekey C:\transip.key`
