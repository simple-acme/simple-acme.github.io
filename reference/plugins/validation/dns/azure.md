# Azure DNS 
Create the record in Microsoft [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns/).

{% include plugin-seperate.md %}

## Setup
This assumes you already have your DNS managed in Azure; if not, you'll need to set that up first. If you are 
using the Azure DNS option for validation, you'll need to get certain info from your Azure Tenant, and create 
a service principal for simple-acme to use (you'll only need to create on of these - it's basically an account 
that has authority to create DNS records). 
There are two ways to authenticate with Azure:

#### Create Azure AD Service Principal Account
Use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest)
to create an [Azure service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

You then need to give this Service Principal access to change DNS entries. In the Azure Portal:
* Go to `DNS Zones` > `sub.example.com` > `Access Control (IAM)`
* Click `Add`
* For Role, choose `DNS Zone Contributor`
* Assign access to `Azure AD user, group, or application`
* Select your Service Principal
* Click `Save`

#### Use a Managed Service Identity
More information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). Note that configuration can be different depending on your operating system version, e.g. [#1413](https://github.com/win-acme/win-acme/issues/1413).

### Configuring the plugin
During setup of the validation the program will ask several questions. 
Here is to answer them with information from the Azure Portal.

* `DNS Subscription ID`: DNS Zones > `sub.example.com` > `Subscription ID`
* `DNS Resource Group Name`: DNS zones > `sub.example.com` > `Resource Group`

Only when authenticating Service Principal Account:

* `Directory/tenant id`: Azure Active Directory > Properties > `Directory ID`.
* `Application client id`: Azure Active Directory > App registrations > [Service Principal] > `Application ID`.
* `Application client secret`: The password that was generated when you created the Service Principal Account.
