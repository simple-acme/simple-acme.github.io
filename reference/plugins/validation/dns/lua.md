# LuaDNS 
Create the record in [LuaDNS](http://www.luadns.com/)

{% include plugin-seperate.md %}

## Setup
This assumes you already have your DNS managed in LuaDNS; if not, you'll need to set that up first. If you are 
using the LuaDNS option for validation, you'll need to obtain a user name and API key.

## Unattended 
`--validation luadns --luadnsusername xxx --luadnsapikey ***`
