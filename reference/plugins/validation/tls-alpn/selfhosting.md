# Self-hosting
This plugin launches a temporary built-in TCP listener that stores the 
validation details in memory. This requires exclusive access to the port,
so it cannot be used while another application is handling connections.

## Non-default port
Even though the ACME server will always open the validation connection on 
port 443, you may forward that to another port within your internal 
infrastructure. Using the `--validationport` switch you can tell the 
plugin to listen to a specific port.

## Unattended 
`--validationmode tls-alpn-01 [--validation selfhosting] [--validationport 4330]`
