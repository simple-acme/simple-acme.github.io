# Validation plugins

A validation plugin is responsible for providing the ACME server with proof that you own the identifiers 
(host names) that you want to create a certificate for. The 
[ACMEv2 protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-18) defines different 
challenge types, three of which are supported by simple-acme. For wildcard identifiers, only DNS-01 validation is accepted by Let's Encrypt.

## Supported challenge types
The following challenge types are supported by simple-acme. Various plugins exist to automate handeling the challenge. E.g. the file required for HTTP-01 validation may be placed on the local filesystem or uploaded via FTP, and the DNS record required for DNS-01 validation may be created at different providers.
