# HTTP validation
HTTP validation works as follows:
- For each domain (e.g. `sub.example.com`), the ACME server sends a 
challenge consisting of an `x` and `y` value. The truth is actually a little 
more complicated than that, but for the sake of this explanation it will suffice.
- The client has to make sure that when the ACME server makes a request 
to `http://sub.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/x`, the content of the HTTP 
response will be `y` with some specific headers set as well.
- The validation request is *always* made to port 80, that cannot be changed. 
- The ACME server **does** follow 301/302 redirects.
- There may be more than one validation request for the same token, e.g. from 
different locations or different protocols (IPv4/IPv6).
- Let's Encrypt does **not** disclose the source locations of these requests, which 
effectively means that the domain has to be accessible for the public, 
at least for the duration of the validation.
