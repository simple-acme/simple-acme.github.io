Generates an order/certificate for each website found in the source. Only useful when combined with the [IIS](/reference/plugins/source/IIS) source plugin. Not compatible with the [custom CSR](/reference/plugins/source/csr) source.

*) Technically also supported on Linux, though no source plugins on Linux have site indication, so it's practically useless.
