Generates an certificate for each website found in the source. Only useful when combined with the [IIS](/reference/plugins/source/IIS) source plugin. Not compatible with the [custom CSR](/reference/plugins/source/csr) source.

(*) Technically also supported on other platforms, though no source plugins beside IIS have site indication built in, making it practically the same as [Single](/single.md).
