# RSA
Default plugin, generates 3072 bits RSA key pairs. The number of bits can be configured in 
[settings.json](/reference/settings) but may not be less than 2048. For 
improved compatiblitity with Microsoft Exchange, RSA keys are automatically converted to the
`Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider`.
