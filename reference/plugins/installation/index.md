# Installation plugins
Installation plugins are responsible for making the necessary changes to your 
application(s) after successfully creating or renewing a certificate. Currently 
there are two of these plugins.

## Multiple
More than one plugin can run by choosing them in order of execution. In interactive 
mode you will be asked, for unattended mode you can provide a comma separated list, 
e.g. `--installation certificatestore,pemfiles`

## Default (default settings)
In default settings mode the default installation plugin is [IIS Web](/reference/plugins/installation/iisweb). 
This can be changed in [settings.json](/reference/settings).  

## Default (full options / unattended)
In full options and unattended modes there are **no** default installation steps,
which is equivalent to `--installation none`. This can be changed in [settings.json](/reference/settings).  
You can to explicitly choose them from the interface or using the `--installation` switch.
