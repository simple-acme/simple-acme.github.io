## Warmup

Before allowing the ACME server to validate, the program will attempt to request
the validation file itself and note the result of that request in the log. A side 
effect of this is that it forces the application to start in case it's application pool
or equivalent went to sleep, warming up the caches etc. This reduces the chance of 
time-outs during validation. This used to be optional behaviour controlled by the 
`‑‑warmup` switch, but that is no longer in use.

## web.config

Optionally this plugin can place a `web.config` next to the validation file, to 
help IIS properly serve the response. There are [many reasons](/manual/validation-problems) 
why IIS can fail to properly server the file. Some of them can be fixed this way. 

In interactive mode the program will ask you if you want to do this. In unattended mode you 
can request it with the parameter `‑‑manualtargetisiis`

### Changing the template

The web.config that will be copied lives in the root of the program directory with the 
name `web_config.xml`. You can modify it to fit your needs, e.g. for MVC sites you might need:

```XML
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <staticContent>
            <clear/>
            <mimeMap fileExtension = ".*" mimeType="text/json" />
        </staticContent>
        <handlers>
            <clear />
            <add name="StaticFile" 
			path="*" 
			verb="*" 
			type="" 
			modules="StaticFileModule,
			         DefaultDocumentModule,
					 DirectoryListingModule" 
			scriptProcessor="" 
			resourceType="Either"
			requireAccess="Read" 
			allowPathInfo="false" 
			preCondition="" 
			responseBufferLimit="4194304" />
        </handlers>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

Or to disable URL Rewriting you might need to add this (in the beginning, right after `<clear />`).

```XML
<rule name="LetsEncrypt Rule" stopProcessing="true">
    <match url="^\.well-known.*$" />
    <action type="None" />
</rule>
```
