# Sponsorship/donations
Is your business relying on this program to secure customer websites and perhaps even critical 
infrastructure? Then maybe it would be good for your peace of mind then to sponsor its core developer, 
to gain guaranteed future support and good karma at the same time. You can become a regular sponsor 
via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/woutertinus) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/WouterTinus)
