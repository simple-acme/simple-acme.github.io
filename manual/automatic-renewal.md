# Automatic renewal

## Scheduled task
A single scheduled task is responsible to renew *all* certificates created by the program, 
but will only do so when it's actually neccessary. The task is created by the program itself 
after successfully creating the first certificate. The task runs every day and checks two 
conditions to determine if it should renew:
- If the certificate is getting too old. This is based on the known history and validity dates.
- If the source (list of domains) has changed, e.g. an extra binding has been added to an IIS site.
- If the server tells us that a renewal should happen, e.g. due to a security incident.

### Customization
The default renewal period of 55 days can be changed in [settings.json](/reference/settings).
Other properties of the scheduled task can also be changed that way, or from the Task Scheduler itself,
as long as its name left unmodified. By default it runs at 9:00 am using the `SYSTEM` account.

### Health checks
The health of the scheduled task is checked each time the program is run manually. It can also 
be (re)created from the menu (`More options...` > `(Re)create scheduled task`).

## Monitoring
The renewal process can be monitored from the Windows Event Viewer and log files 
written to `%programdata%\win-acme\$baseuri$\Log`. You can also set up email notifications 
by configuring a mail server in [settings.json](/reference/settings). 
You can test these notifications from the menu (`More options...` > `Test email notification`).

## Testing and troubleshooting
To test or troubleshoot the renewal process, renewals can be triggered manually from the menu or the 
command line with the `--renew --force` switches. We recommend doing so while running with the 
`--verbose` parameter to get maximum log visibility. When listing the details for a renewal, the 
program will show any errors that have been recorded during previous runs.
