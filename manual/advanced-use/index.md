# Advanced use
The default settings works well for the most common use case, but there are many 
reasons to go for full options mode. For example:
- You don't use IIS
- You need to use [DNS validation](/reference/plugins/validation/dns) because
	- You are requesting a wildcard certificate
	- Port 80 is blocked on your network
- You are not running the program from your web server
- You are load balancing
- You need to run a script after each renewal, e.g. for [Exchange](/manual/advanced-use/examples/exchange)

## Interactive
This describes the basic steps of an full options rewenal from the interactive menu. It touches 
on concepts described [here](/reference/plugins/), because this mode of operation 
exposes more of the internal logic of the program to use to your advantage. Don't worry if
this seems overwhelming: most options have sensible defaults that you can select by just 
pressing `<Enter>` in response to a question.

- Choose `M` in the main menu to create a new certificate in full options mode
- Choose a [source plugin](/reference/plugins/source/) that will be used 
  to determine which domain(s) should be included in the renewal.
- Choose an [order plugin](/reference/plugins/order/) that can be used to split the source
  into one or more certificates, for example of you want to have a separate certificate for
  each site or host name.
- Choose a [validation plugin](/reference/plugins/validation/) to pick the
  method that will be used to prove ownership of your domain(s) to the ACME server.
- Pick between RSA and EC private keys, which are both [plugins](/reference/plugins/csr/) 
  used to generate a certificate signing request (CSR). 
- One or more [store plugins](/reference/plugins/store/) must be selected to save
  the certificate(s). For Apache, nginx and others web servers the `PemFiles` plugin is commonly 
  chosen.
- One or more [installation plugins](/reference/plugins/installation/) can be selected 
  to run after the certificate(s) have been requested. The standard IIS option is of course 
  available, but also the powerful [script installer](/reference/plugins/installation/script).
- A registration with the ACME server is created, if it doesn't already exist. You will be 
  asked to agree to the terms of service and to optionally provide an email address that the server 
  administrators can use to contact you.
- The program negotiates with ACME server to try and prove your ownership of the domain(s) that you want to 
  create the certificate for, using the method of your choice. Getting validation right is often the most tricky 
  part of getting an ACME certificate. At this stage [global validation settings](/manual/advanced-use/global-validation) 
  will take preference over settings specified in the renewal. If there are problems please check out some 
  [common issues](/manual/validation-problems).
- After validating the domains, a certificate signing requests are prepared according to 
  your specifications.
- The certificate signing requests are submitted to the ACME server and the signed responses are saved 
  by the store plugins according to your wishes.
- The program runs the requested installation steps for each of the requested certificates.
- The program remembers all of the choices that you made during this initial setup stage, and applies them 
for each subsequent [renewal](/manual/automatic-renewal).

## Unattended
By providing the right [command line arguments](/reference/cli) at start up you can do 
everything that is possible in interactive mode (and more) without having to jump through the menu's.
This is great way to make simple-acme part of a larger automation workflow.

An easy way to get started with unattended operation is to set up some certificates manually first and then 
use the `L` option in the renewal manager to see the equivalent command line arguments. Note that some 
advanced scenarios are not possible through the command line (e.g. multiple installation scripts), so if you
need to automate those there's no alternative but to manipulate the `.json` files themselves.

### Examples
The `--source` switch, used to select a [source plugin](/reference/plugins/source/), 
triggers the unattended creation of new certificate.

- `--source manual` - selects the [manual plugin](/reference/plugins/source/manual).
- `--source iis` - selects the [iis plugin](/reference/plugins/source/iis).

Each plugin has their own inputs which it needs to generate the certificate, for example:

```wacs.exe --source manual --host www.domain.com --webroot C:\sites\wwwroot```
```wacs.exe --source iis --siteid 1 --excludebindings exclude.me```

There are some other parameters needed for first-time unattended use (e.g. on a clean server) 
to create the Let's Encrypt registration automatically (```--emailaddress myaddress@example.com --accepttos```). 
So a full command line to create a certificate for IIS site 1 on a clean server (except for 
the 'exclude.me' binding) would look like this:

```wacs.exe --source iis --siteid 1 --excludebindings exclude.me --emailaddress myaddress@example.com --accepttos```
