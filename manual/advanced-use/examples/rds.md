How to generate a Certificate for Microsoft Remote Desktop Servers

## Running the client
Assuming you've a simple all in one Remote Desktop Server setup with the roles RD Gateway, 
RD Connection Broker and RD Web Access, you have to import the certificate into the IIS 
site and additionally configure it for the installed RD roles. For IIS the standard plugin 
is used, for the RD roles, the included `ImportRDSFull.ps1` is used.

## Configuration
In order for this script to work, the private key of the certificate needs to be marked 
as exportable. Set `PrivateKeyExportable` in `settings.json` to `true`.

The script accepts two parameters: CertThumbprint and RDCB. RDCB specifies the Remote Desktop 
Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker) server for a Remote Desktop deployment. If you 
don't specify a value, the script uses the local computer's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

## Unattended
- When specific domain names are configured in the IIS bindings, we can use them automatically
`wacs.exe ‑‑source iis ‑‑siteid 1 ‑‑certificatestore My ‑‑installation iis,script ‑‑script "Scripts\ImportRDSFull.ps1" ‑‑scriptparameters "{CertThumbprint}"`

- When only blank/catch-all binding are configured in IIS, we have to be explicit about the domain name(s) that we want
`wacs.exe ‑‑source manual ‑‑host rds.example.com ‑‑certificatestore My ‑‑installation iis,script ‑‑installationsiteid 1 ‑‑script "Scripts\ImportRDSFull.ps1" ‑‑scriptparameters "{CertThumbprint}"`
