# Examples
There are some [example scripts](https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/tree/master/dist/Scripts) bundled with simple-acme releases as a reference and inspiration for people looking to handle custom 
[installation](/reference/plugins/installation/script) or
[DNS validation](/reference/plugins/validation/dns/script).

        <p>Example scripts have been tested by their authors, but as always you should exercise <strong>extreme caution</strong> when running something that you find on the internet, because every environment is different. You may have a different system design or software versions, so always test thoroughly and create your own local copy to prevent future versions of the example from causing issues.</p>
